# Cities 2023

## Author
   Jack Ramsay

## Contents
   A program that queries and updates population figures for a list of major European cities.

## Features
   * City Map:
      A map of all the cities with current pop. figures. It's displayed on a warped map of Europe that is 80 characters wide and 50 lines long.
   * User Interface:
      A text-based UI that contains a list of core functions.
   * Cities List:
      A txt file that contains the list of cities - do not write from this as its formatted precisely.  

## Design & Implementation Rationale
   There isn't much of my own creativity in this project as it was quite basic. The quality of the code itself was more of a prioritisation than extra features. As such, I made the program and ensured I ticked of all the requirements for the project. The size of the city map is odd, but again, those were the exact specification of the size, and Iceland doesn't really help.
